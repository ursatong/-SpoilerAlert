#\#HackWeek 2014Q1 Project

TV show characters interact a lot with their audience during air-time on Twitter. This is very nice. However, not everyone watches the show at the same time (East coast vs west coast, DVR, etc.), they have to avoid their timeline if they are following these characters. It will be nice if we can hide these potentially spoilers for them.

This extension works on all twitter.com pages, It filters all tweets mentions #SpoilerAlert (case insensitive).

When you click to show a spoiler, it will show all spoiler tweets from that account post before it. You can also specify to always show spoiler tweets from certain account.
